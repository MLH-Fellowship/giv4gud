*an app that connects individuals to local shelters to donate their excess items* 

# Inspiration:
People tend to buy items (especially food) in bulk to save money, but a lot of those items go to waste. We thought it would be beneficial if there was an app to connect individuals to local shelters or non-profit organizations so they can donate those excess items instead of throwing them away or letting them go to waste.

# How it works:
Upon entering the app, users will be able to sign up if they don't have an account, or log in if they do. When they sign up, they will have the option to create an account as an individual -- who intends to donate items -- or an organization -- who will accept those donations. 

Individuals will see a list of organizations with their contact information, and items needed. When they choose an organization, they can input the amount of items they want to donate, which will get sent over to the organization for approval.

On the other hand, the organization will be able to create a donation list that contains the items they need, the quantity, and state if this item is a priority, and they can access all these information in home page. In the same page, they can find the list of people who intend to donate certain items, and choose to accept or decline the donations to avoid duplicates.
